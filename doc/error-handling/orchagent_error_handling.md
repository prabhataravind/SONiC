### Overview

Orchagent is one of the most critical components in SONiC that is responsible for translating the data generated by applications into SAI objects that can be pushed down to the hardware via the southbound interface. As such, the reliability of this component is of great importance to the stability and availability of system running SONiC. Currently, most of the ASIC/SAI programming failures in SONiC result in a crash/restart of orchagent which can potentially cause dataplane impact and degraded customer experience. This is a day-1 behavior which is acceptable in certain cases but undesirable in most customer deployments. The intent of this document is to come up with a design where such errors are handled gracefully by orchagent without a crash or restart while notifying applications of those errors using appropriate return values. The application may then choose to act on the error as appropriate.

#### Requirements

The requirements for orchagent error handling improvement are as follows:

    - Handle all ASIC/SAI programming errors gracefully without causing orchagent to crash or restart
    - Return appropriate value (zero or non-zero) to applications so that they can determine the right error recovery mechanism (For eg: rollback or retry)
    - Add appropriate logs when an error is handled to aid debugging or automated log analysis tools

#### Motivation

Orchagent is of great significance in SONiC design primarily because of it being an intermediary between applications and the ASIC. An issue in orchagent can potentially cause missed notifications to the ASIC-DB potentially causing catastrophic imapct down the line. In addition, there could be situations where certain operations may not be synced to ASIC-DB either due to missing dependencies, system resource unavailibility or other gating sanity check failures. It is imperative that in addition to taking appropriate actions such as aborting the operation or retrying the operation, a meaningful message is logged into syslog so that automation can monitor and remediate such situations in a timely manner. Lastly but most importantly, since orchagent crash brings down dataplane, it does not make sense to let it crash for all failed operations, especially for trivial cases like an ADD operation for an object that already exists or a DEL operation for an object that has already been deleted. This was a day-1 design decision and probably one that made sense in the early days of adoption for SONiC. It was a simple and efficient way to recover a potentially degraded dataplane and start everything afresh but as orchagent and SONiC as a whole has evolved to such a scale that such dataplane disruptions with potentially huge customer impact can no longer be justified. It is therefore of utmost importance to improve error detection and handling in orchagent inorder to make SONiC more resilient and reliable.

### Architecture Design

No change in SONiC architecture is intended with this orchagent error handling behavioral change.

### High-Level Design

There are three potential ways in which orchagent behavior today can be improved:

1. Avoid missed notifications from APP_DB to orchagent

There have been instances where orchagent missed certain APP_DB table entry notifications in a race condition with a rather innocuous logrotate event. This caused those notifications to linger in the redis channel between APP_DB and orchagent without being consumed atll by Orchagent. It is quite obvious that this can be quite detrimental for entries which undergo lots of updates under normal circumstances. For eg: a link down event on a portchannel member may not be synced to ASIC-DB due to this resulting in traffic blackhole. While the root cause of that was a bug in code which was fixed later, it was understood that such conditions are painfully difficult to debug and mitigate without proper failsafe mechanisms. One of the mechanisms that we propose to alleviate this problem is to have a script that monitors APP_DB for unconsumed entries (which appear with an underscore prefix in redis DB) periodically using monit framework and nudge the notifications down to orchagent using REDIS PUBLISH command so they get consumed right away.

2. Detect out-of-sync entries between APP_DB and ASIC_DB

This is a situation that is similar to the one discussed above, but slightly different in the sense that these notifications are not missed by Orchagent. These notifications have been processed by orchagent but have not been synced to ASIC-DB due to either failed dependency checks or other conflicts resulting in retries. In this case the entries are part of m_toSync data structure until they are successfully added to ASIC_DB. A good example for such a situation is where a route addition fails when the nexthop neighbor is not resolved. This will trigger a set of retries in orchagent with the expectation that it will eventually succeed, however in many cases the situation may not resolve itself and will need an intervention. Such situations are easily overlooked when trying to narrow down the root cause for a traffic loss scenario in a complex network deployment. While route_check.py script does help to identify such routes which are out of sync between APP_DB and ASIC_DB, a more generic object-agnostic way of determining entries that are out of sync between APP_DB and ASIC_DB at any given time is needed. Our proposal is to either leverage the script used in #1 to also determine such pending entries in a periodic manner using monit or otherwise extend the main loop of orchagent to check for pending entries after each iteration, i.e after executing doTask() methods for all the orchs in m_orchList once.

3. Avoid self-induced orchagent aborts in response to SAI errors

The most significant change in this proposal is to do away with self-induced orchagent crashes when a SAI API call fails (i.e, when the call returns anything other than SAI_STATUS_SUCCESS) as is the case for a large proportion of SAI errors handled today by different orchs that constitute orchagent.

The following SAI errors are planned to be gracefully handled by orchagent without causing it to exit:

    - SAI_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED
    - SAI_STATUS_NO_MEMORY
    - SAI_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER
    - SAI_STATUS_ITEM_ALREADY_EXISTS
    - SAI_STATUS_ITEM_NOT_FOUND
    - SAI_STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_PORT_NUMBER
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_PORT_MEMBER
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_VLAN_ID
    - SAI_STATUS_UNINITIALIZED
    - SAI_STATUS_TABLE_FULL
    - SAI_STATUS_MANDATORY_ATTRIBUTE_MISSING
    - SAI_STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
    - SAI_STATUS_ADDR_NOT_FOUND
    - SAI_STATUS_OBJECT_IN_USE
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_OBJECT_TYPE
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_OBJECT_ID
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_NV_STORAGE
    - SAI_STATUS_NV_STORAGE_FULL
    - SAI_STATUS_SW_UPGRADE_VERSION_MISMATCH
    - SAI_STATUS_NOT_EXECUTED
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_X
    - SAI_STATUS_INVALID_ATTR_VALUE_X
    - SAI_STATUS_ATTR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_X
    - SAI_STATUS_UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE_X
    - SAI_STATUS_ATTR_NOT_SUPPORTED_X

    The orchagent error handling behavioral changes introduced here will be the standard behavior going forward on all SONiC platforms with no option to retain the existing behavior. All changes will be limited to orchagent inside the swss container and in a standalone script that is run periodically using monit infrastructure in SONiC.

## Orchagent changes

### 1. Proposed changes to detect and mitigate missed notifications from APP_DB to orchagent

A new python script will be introduced whose job is to verify that there are no notifications from APP_DB that are yet to be seen or consumed by orchagent over a specified period of time. The initial plan is to introduce this monitoring and mitgation only for certain dynamic APP_DB tables that undergo a lot of churn. The workflow for the script is as follows:

* Read APP_DB tables once for pending entries.
* Wait 30 seconds.
* Read APP_DB tables again for pending entries
* If there are overlapping entries between both reads,
    * Add that table to the list of tables to be synced
* Go through all the tables that need to be synced
    * Publish the pending entries for that table using "sonic-db-cli APPL_DB publish" command

This script will be called periodically using monit infrastructure and alert will be generated by monit if the script returns a non-zero status for 3 cycles. This helps in faster detection and mitigation of such issues.

### 2. Proposed orchagent changes to detect out-of-sync entries between APP_DB and ASIC_DB

A new binary query_orchagent will be introduced in swss container which will talk to orchagent using redis notification channels ORCHAGENTQUERY and ORCHAGENTQUERYREPLY similar to the RESTARTCHECK and RESTARTREPLY channels used for warm restart readiness check.
pending_entries_check will act as the notification producer on PENDINGCHECK channel and be notification consumer on the PENDINGCHECKREPLY channel while switchorch in orchagent will act as the notification producer on PENDINGCHECKREPLY channel and act as the consumer on PENDINGCHECK channel.

    // Send pending entries query via "PENDINGCHECK" notification channel
    swss::NotificationProducer pendingQuery(&db, "PENDINGCHECK");
    //  Listen for the reply on "PENDINGCHECKREPLY" channel
    swss::NotificationConsumer pendingQueryReply(&db, "PENDINGCHECKREPLY");

Call flow:

1. The pending entries check query will be sent using "orchagent" as the opcode and data and the following tuple as part of the swss::FieldValueTuple.

"PendingCheck": "true"

2. When doTask() for switchorch is called, this notification is processed by switchorch which sets a member variable m_getPendingEntries to True

3. At the end of each iteration of the Orchagent's main while loop after doTask() for all orchs have been called, orchagent will call getPendingEntries() function to retrieve the entries that are present in m_toSync map only if switchorch's m_getPendingEntries is set to True

4. getPendingEntries() will call the existing getTaskToSync() function which returns all the pending entries as a vector of strings.

5. getPendingEntries() will then call gsWitchOrch->sendPendingEntriesResponse() which will  send the pending entries to query_orchagent process using pendingQueryReply notification channel and subsequently set m_getPendingEntries to False. This ensures that every orchagent loop does not incur an additional cost of processing pending entries.

6. queryOrchagent process will then listen to notifications on "PENDINGCHECKREPLY" channel and retrieve the pending entries in orchagent.

7. queryOrchagent can then compare the most recently obtained set of pending entries to the previously stashed copy of pending entries and determine if any of the entries are stuck in processing beyond a specific timeframe of 5 minutes. If so, a WARNING message can be logged into syslog so that debugging and mitigation of such issues become simpler.


### 3. Proposed orchagent changes to avoid self-induced orchagent aborts in response to SAI errors

1. When orchagent receives an error notification from syncd for a SAI API call that failed,
one of three actions will be performed in one of the handleSai<Op>Status() functions in orchagent:

 a. If the error is something that can resolve itself with subsequent retries like for eg: SAI_STATUS_OBJECT_IN_USE or SAI_STATUS_TABLE_FULL, orchagent will return task_need_retry

 b. If the error is something that is unlikely to be resolved with a subsequent attempt like for eg: SAI_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED, orchagent will call handleSaiFailure() to invoke SAI dump return task_failed
 with abort_on_failure set to False by default so orchagent does not exit

 c. If the error is rather harmless like SAI_STATUS_ITEM_ALREADY_EXISTS or SAI_STATUS_ITEM_NOT_FOUND, orchagent will return task_success

### SAI API

No new SAI APIs are introduced as part of this functionaility.

### Configuration and management
There are no configuration and management changes introduced as part of this functionality.

#### CLI/YANG model Enhancements

There is no CLI change associated with this functionality.

#### Config DB Enhancements

There is no config DB change needed for this functionality.

### Warmboot and Fastboot Design Impact

This error handling improvement does not have any requirements or dependencies w.r.t warmboot or fastboot.
Warm reboot does not currently go through when there are pending orchagent entries that have yet to be consumed and that behavior will stay as-is.

### Memory Consumption

No significant additional memory overhead is anticipated in implementing this functionality.
